# Scheduler
Scheduler Project

## Objective

Given a list of processes, the goal of this project is to implement a simple process scheduler capable of simulating the behavior of the following scheduling:

-   **First Come First Served (FCFS)**
-   **Preemtive and Non-Preemtive Shortest Job First (SJF) & Priority**
-   **Round Robin (RR)**

The simulator should produce as output the avarage waiting time and average response time for all six scheduling algorithms described above.
